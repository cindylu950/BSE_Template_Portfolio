# 3-Joint Robotic Arm with Claw
I built a 3-jointed robotic arm that can pick up objects. Its movement can be controlled via potentiometers, but it can also enter a mode where it follows a set of pre-written instructions in order to pick up an object and set it down elsewhere.

# Final Milestone
My second and final milestone was finishing the code that allows the robot arm to move. The arm has two modes: potentiometer mode, where the arm's movement can be directly controlled via potentiometers, as well as auto mode, where the arm follows a pre-written set of instructions. Since during auto mode, the servo moved too quickly, I wrote a method that allows for the servos to move more smoothly. I also removed the support I added because it added too much weight to the robotic arm, causing for it to be unable to return to an upright posititon.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was finishing assembling the robot arm. I followed the instructions provided by the building set to assemble it, but I had to disassemble parts after I finished in order to align the robot arm properly. A servo was also improperly attached to the rest of the arm, so I fixed that. In addition, I added a support between the two sides of the robot arm to minimize the rattling of a servo.
