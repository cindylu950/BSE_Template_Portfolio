# 3-Joint Robotic Arm with Claw
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was finishing assembling the robot arm. I followed the instructions provided by the building set to assemble it, but I had to disassemble parts after I finished in order to align the robot arm properly. A servo was also improperly attached to the rest of the arm, so I fixed that. In addition, I added a support between the two sides of the robot arm to minimize the rattling of a servo.
